Hello, my name is Christian Keaunui. 

I am a computer scientist from Seattle, Washington.  
I graduated from Occidental College with a degree in Computer Science in May of 2023, with a focus on data driven operations.  I am currently working as a data analyst at Noson.

        In this project I am exploring solar panels energy production across different regions in the U.S. to determine how cost effective they are. I gathered solar irradiance data from NASA for each U.S. city since 2020, the average household energy usage per year, and average household energy costs per year.  I then calculated the estimated energy production of a Panasonic 360W solar panel at its peak, across its entire lifetime, and the estimated money it would save.  Finally, I visualized the results in Tableau.

        This is a machine learning project which uses the HAM10k dataset from Harvard Dataverse to train a model for classifying images of skin lesions into one of seven different categories.  The data provided was imbalanced, so synthetic data was created through image augmentation for under represented categories  The model I built uses transfer learning on the resnet50 model.

        Since February 2020 I have been playing online chess, and have completed over 7,000 games.  In this project I review those games to gather insights on my strengths and weaknesses as a player.  I used python to gather and clean data from the chess.com api, and saved it to a SQL relational database.  I then analyze and visualize the data in Tableau.

      <td>For my undergraduate thesis, I built and trained a deep reinforcement learning model to play Tetris.  The neural network used a deep Q-learning algorithm to learn, and was trained across 2,000 iterations of Tetris games.  The model is able to far surpass human play, but this is result is largely due to the models movement speed rather than superior organizational abilities.</td>
